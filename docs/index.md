# ez-animate

A high-level, declarative Python package for creating common Matplotlib animations with minimal boilerplate code.

## Project Goals

- **Simplify Matplotlib animations**: No need to write custom `init`/`update` functions or manage state manually.
- **For data scientists, analysts, educators, and researchers**: Quickly create standard animations for analysis, presentations, and teaching.
- **Minimal code, maximum clarity**: Focus on your data and story, not boilerplate.
